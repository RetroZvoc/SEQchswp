# SEQchswp v1.0
SEQ Channel Swapper v1.0
By RetroZvoc

SEQ file format is used in PlayStation 1 games such as Crash Bandicoot 2 as background music. It's similar to the MIDI format, however, there are some differences which make SEQ files significantly hard to modify. One of these issues is that all of the MIDI messages are on a single track. This means that if you want to change instruments of your song, you will have to change the channel numbers for every single note! Since there unfortunately is no good SEQ editor that can do it automatically, here I've made a very simple tool that can help you do this very easily!

In order to use, download the repository as a ZIP file, then run bin/Release/SEQchswp.exe by dragging and dropping your SEQ file. Be sure to make a backup of your SEQ file!!! You'll be asked to choose your desired channels to swap as you'll be guided by the instructions.

If you want to modify the source code, you can do so under the MIT License. You can open this project in CodeBlocks to get a headstart.

If you have any issues with the program, please submit them under the Issues tab of this repository.

Enjoy!
